# Intro

I'm Simrith. I love all things tech, beauty, and fun.

# Some history

- My parents are from Bihar. Their honeymoon was Washington D.C., and five years later, they had my older brother. Three years after that, they were BLESSED with twins--Amrith and Me, Simrith.

- We were curious kids. Sibling rivalry led me to try many sports (Gymnastics, Swimming, Ballet, Running), and to excel in coursework from a young age (specifically math)

- We visited India almost every other year growing up. Taught me more about the world than any one education could.

- In the summer of 2018, I joined Mathcounts competitions. Found out I had a knack for math.

- I made a life-changing decision in 8th grade: attending a public magnet school for high school for science and technology.

- Delayed learning computer science for as long as I could, but found out I could get good at it too!

- After AP Computer Science A, I took Artificial Intelligence and Mobile and Web Development. I LOVED AI, but the class consisted of 5 girls and 29 boys. The next year, I took Computer Vision and Neuroscience Research Lab.

- Even in college, many machine learning opportunities are male-dominated, but that doesn't scare me anymore.

<!-- - My journey into tech is unique to me, but there are countless stories of women  -->
